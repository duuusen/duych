_Tear Up / See You Again_ –《再見 / 睙眼》 are a series of photography, video, sound and performance works that examine and reflect the construction of intricate bonds build by humans. Exploring our own roles as artists and the role of art itself, we aim to share our feelings to the audience and show our main drive behind our work: love.
